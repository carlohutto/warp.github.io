            <h2>Founding Spark</h2>
            <p>WARP was born from a moment of profound personal collapse. An unexpected encounter with the justice system over past warrants resulted in our founders' incarceration. In an instant, their children were displaced to live with other family members, their stability was shattered, and they lost everything they had built.
Forced to rebuild from nothing, they lived the catastrophic ripple effects that a single justice system involvement can cause a family. This experience, while harrowing, became an undeniable catalyst. It revealed the critical gaps in support for individuals and families navigating this crisis. WARP is the result of that lived experience—a commitment to ensuring others have the resources and guidance to rebuild their lives with dignity and hope.</p>

            <h2>Present & Future</h2>
            <p><strong>Our Mission: From Personal Experience to Proactive Solutions</strong></p>
            <p>Our founding story is one of sudden collapse and rebuilding. This lived experience taught us a critical lesson: without proactive support, individuals in crisis can fall through the cracks. That’s why our mission is built on a dual foundation of trauma-informed care and research-based strategy, focusing on critical, interconnected issues like suicide prevention and harm reduction awareness.</p>

            <p>We address the most pressing barriers to successful reentry, and in North Carolina, the number one barrier is clear: a lack of reliable transportation. What good is a Fair Chance employer if someone cannot get to work reliably? Without the ability to maintain employment and provide for themselves, individuals face increased risks of recidivism, substance use, and despair.</p>

            <p>This is the driving force behind our most innovative initiative, <strong>Picture Me Rollin’</strong>. This program directly tackles the transportation barrier by providing eligible individuals with reliable personal vehicles. It’s a simple, powerful solution to a complex problem.</p>

            <p><strong>Investing in this solution is an investment with tangible returns:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For the Individual:</strong> It restores dignity, independence, and the ability to build a stable life.</li>
                <li><strong>For the Community & Local Economy:</strong> It creates a reliable workforce, boosts local spending, and reduces recidivism, which lowers public safety costs.</li>
                <li><strong>For Your Business:</strong> Your donation is tax-deductible and directly fuels local economic growth and stability. It’s a practical investment in creating a more resilient community for everyone.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We invite you to join us. Form a strategic partnership, collaborate on our initiatives, or make a donation today. Your support isn’t just charity; it’s a direct investment in a proven, practical solution that builds a safer, stronger, and more prosperous community for all.</p>
