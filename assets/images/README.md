Place image files used by the site in this folder.

Required filenames (place the corresponding image files here):

- `hero.jpg` — Hero background image (used in the top section)
- `mission.jpg` — Image for the Mission section
- `job-readiness.jpg` — Image for Job Readiness & Training program card

Steps to add images:
1. Save each image with the exact filename above.
2. Put them in this folder: `assets/images/` (for example `assets/images/hero.jpg`).
3. Refresh your browser at http://localhost:8000 to see the updated images.

If you'd like me to add the image files directly, upload them here and I'll commit them into the repository for you.
