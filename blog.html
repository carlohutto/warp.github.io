        <h2>Why We're Here</h2>
        <p>Every person deserves a second chance. But for justice-impacted families, that chance often feels impossibly out of reach. Harm Reduction Awareness. Mental health support. Transportation to and from work. Stable housing. These aren't luxuriesâ€”they're lifelines. And too often, they simply don't exist.</p>

        <p>That's why WARP exists. We're building a network of partners across the private and public sectors to create meaningful opportunities for people coming home from incarceration and their families. We align our programs with the CSG Justice Center's five evidence-based measures for successful reentry because we believe in doing this work right.</p>

        <p>We're new. We're learning. But we're committed.</p>

        <h3>The Crisis We Can't Ignore</h3>
        <p>On November 1st, I'll be walking in the Out of the Darkness Walk in Charlotteâ€”not just as one of WARP's cofounders, but as someone who has lost several friends to suicide. I will be remembering all of my lost friends but especially my childhood best friend Eric Allen Jones. EJ was full of light, laughter, and life. His loss taught me something I carry every day: life is fragile, and the people we lose leave holes that never fully heal.</p>

        <p>The connection between incarceration and suicide is devastating and often overlooked. Research shows that people who have been incarcerated face twice the suicide risk compared to those who haven'tâ€”even years after release. For families with a loved one behind bars, the mental health toll is immense. Children with incarcerated parents experience higher rates of depression, anxiety, and trauma.</p>

        <p>These aren't just statistics. They're our neighbors. Our family members. People who deserve support, not stigma.</p>

        <h3>Our Initiatives: Partnering for Change</h3>
        <h4>Suicide Prevention & Awareness</h4>
        <p>We're participating in the Out of the Darkness Walk on November 1st because mental health can't be an afterthought in reentry work. Join us. Walk with us. Help us shine a light on a crisis that thrives in silence.</p>
        <p>See the AFSP link above for more info.</p>

        <h4>Harm Reduction Awareness Campaign</h4>
        <p>We are actively seeking out strategic partnerships to reduce substance-related harm in justice-impacted communities through education and evidence-based practices.</p>

        <h4>Transportation Initiative (PMR)</h4>
        <p>Lack of reliable transportation is the number one barrier to successful reentry in North Carolina. We are working on an app and partnering with local car dealerships and community organizations to donate operable vehicles to an innovative Turo-like vehicle sharing program to help families rebuild their lives. Our program is focused on accessibility not ownership. Without access to reliable transportation, there are no fair chances.</p>

        <h3>Let's Connect</h3>
        <p>We have lived experience. We understand the barriers because we've faced them. But we're also honest about what we don't know yetâ€”running and growing a nonprofit is new territory for us.</p>

        <p>What we do know is this: We ALL can do better. Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.</p>

        <p>If you're reading this and thinking, "I want to be part of the solution," we need you. Whether you can donate, volunteer, partner with us, or simply spread the wordâ€”every connection matters.</p>

        <p>Because second chances aren't just about policy or programs. They're about people. And every person deserves the chance to come home and build a life worth living.</p>

        <p><strong>Join us on November 1st for the Out of the Darkness Walk in Charlotte.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Donate. Partner. Connect. Let's build something better, together.</strong></p>
