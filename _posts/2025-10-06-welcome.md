Welcome â€” this is the first post on the WARP NC blog. Posts are written in Markdown and stored in the `_posts/` directory. To add a new post, create a file with the name format `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md` and push it to the repository.

You can edit posts via the GitHub web UI or locally with your editor and `git`.
