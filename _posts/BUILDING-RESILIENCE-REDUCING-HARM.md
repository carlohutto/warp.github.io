# Resilience in Action: WARP's Next Chapter

## Moving Forward Together

Since launching WARP, we've been building—quietly, intentionally, and with purpose. In November, we joined thousands at the Out of Darkness Walk for suicide prevention. Shortly after, we received our 501(c)(3) designation, which isn't about validation but about accountability. It means we can serve more effectively through expanded partnerships and resources.

This week's ice storm reminded us why this work matters. Power outages, closed roads, and disrupted routines aren't just inconveniences for justice-impacted families already living on the edge—they're compounding crises. When stability is fragile, chaos hits harder.

## Building Inner Strength

We've centered our mission around the **Community Resiliency Model (CRM)**—an evidence-based approach that teaches people to regulate their nervous systems during stress. CRM empowers individuals to recognize overwhelm and use simple wellness skills to return to balance. It's peer-led, accessible, and transformative for communities healing from trauma.

We're also developing the **"Stay Free" journal**, a guided resource for people navigating reentry. Through reflections, prompts, and thoughtful wisdom, it helps individuals process their experiences and envision their futures.

We believe self-talk is the GPS that guides one toward a softly spoken destiny. The inner voice matters. The stories we tell ourselves shape everything.

Reentry is uncertain. The path is rarely smooth. But resilience can be learned, practiced, and shared.

We're here to walk that path alongside our community—one day, one tool, one person at a time.
